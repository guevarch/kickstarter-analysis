## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise would like to know more about how the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and funding goals. 
The purpose of the project is to analyze the outcomes based on the Launch Start Date and the Goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

From the analysis of the outcomes based on launch date, the most successful months are May and June and the least successful months are November and December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

From the analysis of outcomes based on goals, the higher the goal amount the lower the success rate. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some of the limitations of the data set include the outliers that would skew the data in either direction. A possible solution is to identify the outliers using mean, standard dev., median and IQR analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some of the possible tables/graphs we could create is the box and whisker plots.
